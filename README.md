# machine-learning-trading-algorithm
I create 2 trading algorithm that uses a short and long window Simple Moving Average (SMA) to generate trading signals. One model uses the support vector machine (SVM) classifier from the scikit-learn library to fit the training data and make predictions. The other model uses the LogisticRegression classifier from the scikit-learn library.
